# Tutor-s-Point
This is a software made in java to stream video tutorials

Most of the times students learn something from a video rather than a text. So, this software can help the student to watch video tutorials
from the teachers who upload the videos.

Teachers have different login and they can upload the video only when they specify the subject and sub-subject(optional).
Teachers can see the comments made by the student in the video and manage its visibility from there only.

Students can watch the video, rate the video and filter the video by the author name, sbuject name, sub-subject name and sort according to
the ratings provided the students.
